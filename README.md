# Heuns-Method
Better than tha Euler's method. It takes the average of initial and the final velocity to calculate the acceleration which gives more precise results than the Euler's method.
The new position is given by the initial position at the start of the time segment + (the time segment x the average of the initial and the final velocity).
Same goes for finding the new velocity
